## Getting Started

Install the package

```bash
yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Threee different kind of page is available to check.

Static Page : [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
Server Side Rendered Page : [http://localhost:3000/server](http://localhost:3000/server)
Client Side Rendered Page : [http://localhost:3000/client](http://localhost:3000/client)

Even though the design wasn't really efficient, I still tried to make the page responsive. To host the website, I relocated the api to the same repository as the front-end code. In order to display the loader state on client and server side pages, I also added a waiting time of 2 seconds to the API.

Website is also hosted on : [https://harbor-test.vercel.app/](https://harbor-test.vercel.app/)
